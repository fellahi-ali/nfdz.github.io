            I am a cheerful, reliable, team player and communicative person. Lover of the technological challenges,

            I am a software engineer and developer with a very varied background currently specializing in mobile
            development and in particular Android. I have been lucky enough to study and work in many different fields.

            There is nothing in this world I admire more than the ability to beat the security of the known and go beyond the comfort.
            I think business culture is very important and in the last few years many companies have developed new approaches in their
            way of working and I know I could contribute in many ways to them.

            My goal is to develop my capacity as an engineer, contribute everything I can always to the company I belong to and

            I have many ideas all the time. However, an idea is worthless if I am not able to execute it correctly.
            So, I'd rather be able to run a bad idea than wasting my time thinking hundreds of mind-boggling ideas.
          </p>

            Throughout my career I've touched the entire Full-Stack, I like the idea of being able to create a complete product

            I had to deal with management tasks, being responsible of small projects and staff, applying agile methodologies,

            Although for the time being, I have been mainly engaged in engineering tasks I do not discard in the future
            to learn and work more in the management part since I think it is vital to be part of both worlds.

                  In this work I was lucky to be able to work on the development of a new and very innovative product from scratch.
                  I learned a lot with my workmates and team leader, whom I appreciate very much and I thank him for all the time he dedicated to me.
                  Over time, more and more responsibilities were delegated to me, such as the control of the schedule,
                  meeting of clients, documentation, user training, deliveries, management of people in my charge,
                  specification of new requirements and features, choice of technologies and development lines.

                  As a multinational company I had workmates and customers from the whole world and the documentation and code
                  followed international standards. The sector is a critical infrastructure and the product is expected to have the highest quality.
                  Therefore, an important part of my work was to ensure the quality of software with unit tests, continuous integration, design patterns,
                  simulation and validation environments. The technologies mainly involved were Java, Eclipse RCP, Python, Protocol buffers,
                  CORBA, HornetQ, C ++, JUnit.

                      I got an internship to work in the development of <a href="https://vimeo.com/175511126" target="_blank">UGV</a>.
                      The mission board system was a real-time linux distribution and the programming language was mainly C and C++ for some specific features.
                      Some of my tasks were:

                  Teaching innovation project software developer
                  This was my first serious professional experience with timing, remuneration and final users. I was still studying my university degree.
                  The teachers designed the project idea and my job was to carry it out completely. Leaving me freely,
                  I designed and developed the technical section and the design. Leading a team of two students. Basically it was a web application.
                  The technologies involved were PHP/MySQL for the backend and HTML/CSS/Javascript for the frontend.
