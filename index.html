          <p class="left-text">
            I am always thinking of wonderful ideas. However, an idea is worthless if I am not able to execute it correctly.
            Instead, I would rather be able to run an idea to the best of my ability than spend the precious hours thinking of mind-boggling ideas.

          <p class="left-text">
            Recently, I was able to specialize in Java technologies.
            However, throughout my career I have touched the entire Full-Stack, I like the idea of being able to create a complete product
            on my own.

            I was given management tasks in which I was responsible for small projects and delegating work to my team. I was able to use agile methodologies,

            I have been recently more involved with engineering duties, but I am open to return to the management role

            I have worked on many interesting projects where I have learned a lot since I was in high school. Following,

                <p>
                  I was able to work on the development of a new and very innovative product from scratch.
                  I learned a lot with my workmates and team leader, whom I appreciate very much and I thank him for all the time he dedicated to me.
                  Over time, more and more responsibilities were delegated to me, such as the control of the schedule,
                  meeting of clients, documentation, user training, deliveries, management of people in my charge,
                  specification of new requirements and features, choice of technologies and development lines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a multinational company, I had workmates and customers from the whole world and the documentation and code
                  followed international standards. The sector is a critical infrastructure and the product is expected to have the highest quality.
                  Therefore, an important part of my work was to ensure the quality of software with unit tests, continuous integration, design patterns,
                  simulation and validation environments. The technologies mainly involved were Java, Eclipse RCP, Python, Protocol buffers,
                  CORBA, HornetQ, C++, JUnit.

                  I got an internship to work in the development of an <a href="https://vimeo.com/175511126" target="_blank">UGV</a>.
                  The mission board system was a real-time linux and the programming language was mainly C and C++ for some specific features.
                  Some of my tasks were:

                  This was my first professional experience with timing, remuneration and final users. I was still studying my university degree.
                  The teachers designed the project idea and my job was to carry it out completely. Leaving me freely,
                  I designed and developed the technical solution and the user experience. I was the leader of a team of two students. It was a web application and
                  the technologies involved were PHP/MySQL for the backend and HTML/CSS/Javascript for the frontend.
